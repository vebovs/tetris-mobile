        The goal of Tetris is to fill the area using whatever pieces are given to you and leave as few unfilled spaces as possible.
        The piece will steadily fall and it’s your job to control where they fall to achieve the previously stated goal.
        To aid you in this matter you can move the piece horizontally left and right using the Left and Right buttons displayed.
        Each click of each button moves the piece in single increments in whatever direction you’ve specified.
        The Rotate button allows you to rotate the piece 90 degrees in a clockwise direction, again, to help you better fit the piece.
